This is the first post in the DevBlog and BadTakes series.

I’m starting this devblog to maintain coding consistency and to have a platform where I can share my thoughts. After all, if no one sees your work, it can feel like it’s all for nothing.

The DevBlog series will include posts about what I’m currently working on. My goal is to expand these ideas to other platforms if they prove valuable. For now, I’ll focus on building up consistency through this blog.

The BadTakes series will feature my opinions on various dev-related topics. I aim to explore what practices are beneficial, what might be overkill, and the efficiency of different approaches. I think it's interesting to contrast best practices in large companies with what's necessary for solo developers.

These are the two main series I’ll be focusing on for now, but I might introduce new categories in the future. We’ll see how it evolves.
